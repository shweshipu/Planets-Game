# Planets-game
> Solo project from 2021-2022. I didn't know that i should have been using version control at the time. I really wish I had.


As an end product, I hope to make it into a game similar to games from the Sid Meier's Civilization series.
The main difference being that instead of playing on a Hex grid map, It would be played on multiple [Goldberg polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldberg_polyhedron) acting as planets. As players progressed they would make it to other planets.

So far, only the goldberg polyhedra were implemented, mostly thanks to [this fine person's adaptation](https://github.com/Em3rgencyLT/Hexasphere) of [this other fine person's amazing code](https://github.com/arscan/hexasphere.js/). I just adapted it to GDScript. I also made some behind the scenes implementation of game mechanics, but I hadn't gotten around to them yet.

What I learned from this project:
- exposure to javascript
- some of how godot's graphic generating libraries work
- version control is essential
- its very satisfying to make code where you can see the results in color


Most of the code is in the Scripts/Planet folder. Most of the other files in Scripts/ are just skeletons for future planned mechanics.
